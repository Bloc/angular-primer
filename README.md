# Angular exercises for [Workshop](https://workshop.bloc.io/).

## Summary

Create an interactive todo list by learning the basics of AngularJS.

## Description

HTML and CSS allow you to create and style content, and JavaScript allows your users to interact with this content. But coordinating between these two worlds can be difficult.

AngularJS is a very popular JavaScript web framework that helps you coordinate information between these languages. It adds additional HTML vocabulary to your web app, which makes coordinating with JavaScript faster, simpler, and easier to understand.

By the end of this course, you'll have a todo web app that shows a list of tasks, and an interactive form that allows users to add new tasks without reloading the page.

## Objectives

After this course, students should be able to:

- Identify a `<script>` tag that imports AngularJS
- Define the steps to initialize AngularJS
- Identify the `ng-app` HTML attribute
- Explain what mustache brackets (`{{ }}`) do in AngularJS
- Describe how to print a JavaScript object using AngularJS
- Identify code that creates an AngularJS controller
- Describe how `$scope` can be used to transfer information from an AngularJS controller to an HTML page
- Define and compare the `ngModel`, `ngClick`, and `ngRepeat` directives
- Build a simple web app using those three directives
