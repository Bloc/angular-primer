Welcome to Bloc's Angular primer! During this course, you will learn about AngularJS, a popular JavaScript-based web application framework.

### Objectives

- Identify a `<script>` tag that imports AngularJS

### Example

The `<script>` tag can import external scripts. Google hosts AngularJS at `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.9/angular.min.js`.

### Exercise

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```
